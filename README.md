__________

## What is Blynk?
Blynk provides **iOS** and **Android** apps to control any hardware **over the Internet** or **directly using Bluetooth**.
You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets, **right on your smartphone**.
Blynk is **the most popular IoT platform** used by design studios, makers, educators, and equipment vendors all over the world.

## Quickstart: Arduino + Ethernet shield

* Download the Blynk app ([App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blynk-control-arduino-raspberry/id808760481?ls=1&mt=8), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.blynk))
* Get the Auth Token from the app
* Import this library to Arduino IDE. Guide [here](http://arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries)
* In Arduino IDE, select File -> Examples -> Blynk -> Boards_Ethernet -> Arduino_Ethernet
* Update Auth Token in the sketch and upload it to Arduino
* Connect your Arduino with Ethernet shield to the internet

Please find examples on how to use different types of connections (transports) and how to do make something great with Blynk.
You can easily apply any type of board/connection to all examples.
